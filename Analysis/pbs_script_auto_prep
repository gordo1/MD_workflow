# pbs launching script          may 2013
# 	
#  This script is designed for the pre-processing of data at the completion of a run
#  -often the amount of data that one is trying to process is far greater than possible on 
#  a simple desktop.  This script will hopefully aggregate the data using an smp node plus 
#  a large amount of memory.  A second script will strip out the waters and hydrogen to 
#  greatly reduce the memory footprint for further processing.  

#PBS -l procs=4 
#PBS -l walltime=4:0:0
#PBS -q batch

# For most jobs this should be plenty, otherwise increase! (say, pvmem=128gb)
#PBS -l pvmem=64gb

# To run on Merri
module load vmd/1.9.1

#First step:  Aggregate the data

./a1_extract_all_my_data.sh

# Second step: create no hydrogen no water dcd trajectory with vmd (text mode) 

./a2_create_dcd_no_H_no_H2O.tcl

# Optional steps: 

./a3_protein_backbone_cluster_analysis.tcl
./a4_ligand_cluster_analysis.tcl
