## Project Planning

This document is designed to help the user properly plan their molecular
dynamics experiments.  We encourage users to fill this out prior to a MD
experiment, to both justify the rationale and also keep a record for future
reference. Remember, any experiment that is not written up or used in future
work may as well not been run at all.

To aid this process we'll subscribe to 'Heilmeier's catechisms'

## Heilmeier catechisms

### What are you trying to do

### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice

### What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful

### Who cares

### If you're successful, what difference will it make

### What are the risks and the payoffs

### How much will it cost

### How long will it take

### What are the midterm and final indicators to check for success

## Experimental Design

Equilibrium stage?

Size /temperature?

Ensemble.  NVT / NPT?

Temperature control?

Pressure control?

Statistical sampling?

Analysis?  What will you measure from this?

What figures or representation can you make from the results?  Is this
work going result in a publication?

What journal might you hope this work tobe published in.
